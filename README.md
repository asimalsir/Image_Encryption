# Image_Encryption
   Ongoing project...
   Image encryption using hybrid genetic algorithm and chaotic function model for image encryption
    Add an existig image in imread() function.
    decrypt.m--it is encrypting one fourth of the image and then decypting the same.
    final_encryption.m--it is encrptying as well as showing the correlation-coefficient plot of final cipher image.
